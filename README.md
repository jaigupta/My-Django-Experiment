My-Django-Experiment(an amazing projects)
====================

The repository contains a django wesite with a set of django apps built by me to try Django apps.
Currently there are three projects in the repository.

CHAT APP 
--------
The chat app project is a facebook app. My first try into building Django applications.
It connects facebook users anonymously around the world through chat. Those who are connected can chat using the application. After they have a conversation for some amount of time they can reveal their identity. Identities revealed during chat may be fake but this one is trustable as it reveal identity using the facebook profile data and user profile link.
As Facebook changed its API since then, The app is not compatible to be run on the current API.


AUTOMATED WEB-FORM GENERATOR
------------------------
An attempt to something similar to google forms. Users can create their forms for surveys etc through GUI provided by the app on the website. Simple Drag and Drop to position elements and GUI to edit element properties. One can also view the form submission status as a summary with bar graph, pie chart etc. The submission may also be downloaded in Excel format.

IMAGE  IN RAPHAEL
-----------------------
The backed in Django is really simple here built in Django. The main part is the Front end, a GUI for image editing provided by Raphael Libarary. The images are SVG content and are saved into the database.
